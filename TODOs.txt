- consider having a notebook a subclass(type?) of dict
- have a method to scan all existing components of a notebook
- enable entering target dirs for notebooks
- enable cleaning a notebook completely (requires defining what is the base form of a notebook)
- consider how should slicing a nb look like (jq format is a good candidate, but maybe other formats should be supported)
- enable insights into a nb (maybe equivalent to a check, but report how many lines are redundant, unique values etc)
